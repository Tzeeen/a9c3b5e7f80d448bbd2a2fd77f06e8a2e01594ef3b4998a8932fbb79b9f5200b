                    <p class="news-excerpt">Dallas-based cybersecurity startup Island has raised $250 million in
                        fresh
                        funding, boosting its valuation to $4.8 billion. Founded in 2020, the company has now
                        secured
                        $730 million in total funding and serves around 450 enterprise clients, including banks,
                        universities, and retailers. Island's innovative web browser embeds cybersecurity directly
                        into
                        its framework, addressing the growing demand for secure digital tools amid the rise of
                        remote
                        work. The new funds will support product development and expand its 500-person team.</p>

                    <p class="news-excerpt">Defense tech startup Anduril, founded by Palmer Luckey in 2017, has
                        skyrocketed to a $36.3 billion valuation, drawing intense investor interest. Despite the
                        hype,
                        strict stock transfer rules make it difficult to acquire shares, fueling a secondary market
                        frenzy where some buyers are offering $56.67 per share. The excitement stems from Anduril's
                        profitable government contracts, its visionary founder, and a booming environment for
                        defense-focused innovation.</p>

                        his
                        stealth-mode cybersecurity startup, with the round led by Greenoaks. This follows a $20
                        million
                        seed investment from Sequoia, Index Ventures, and Cyberstarts. Despite limited public
                        details,
                        the startup is already valued in the hundreds of millions. Investor excitement is fueled by
                        Alphabet's $32 billion acquisition of Wiz, where these same firms saw early success.</p>

                    <p class="news-excerpt">Wiz, an Israeli cybersecurity powerhouse, has been acquired by Alphabet
                        in a
                        landmark $32 billion deal, making it the largest cybersecurity acquisition in history.
                        Founded
                        by former Unit 8200 members Assaf Rappaport, Ami Luttwak, Yinon Costica, and Roy Reznik,
                        each
                        co-founder will receive over $3 billion from the sale. This historic acquisition surpasses
                        Meta's 2014 WhatsApp deal and sets a new record for private venture-backed exits. Wiz, known
                        for
                        its cutting-edge cybersecurity solutions and partnerships with Fortune 100 companies, will
                        bolster Google Cloud's security, especially in response to growing AI-driven threats.</p>
